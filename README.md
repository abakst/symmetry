# Symmetry  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/abakst/symmetry.svg?branch=prolog_out)](https://travis-ci.org/abakst/symmetry)
Protocol verifier for message passing programs.

This package defines a DSL for writing message passing programs. In theory, programs written in this DSL
may be evaluated in one of two ways:

  1. "As normal", e.g. compilation to Cloud Haskell
  2. "For verification", e.g. analyzed to determine if the underlying communication protocol is well formed

In practice, only "2" is currently implemented.

# How to use

The programmer writes a program in the DSL (Symmetry.Language.AST).

By way of example, assume the file `Prog.hs` contains the following:

~~~~{.haskell}
module Main where

import Symmetry.Language
import Symmetry.Verify

mainProc = {- The program in the DSL -}

main :: IO ()
main = checkerMain mainProc
~~~~

The programmer then compiles the program as normal:

~~~~
$ ghc Prog.hs -o Prog
~~~~

To run the verification, run:

~~~~
$ ./Prog --verify
~~~~

## What's going on

`./Prog --verify`:

  1. creates a first-order abstraction (as a Haskell program) `SymVerify.hs` in `$CWD/.symcheck`;
  2. TODO: runs `Liquid Haskell` on `SymVerify.hs`

If (2) succeeds, then `Prog` is deadlock-free and no assertion fails at runtime.

`./Proc --verify --qc`:

   * Additionally creates a file `QC.hs` that can be run to *test* the `SymVerify.hs` program using `QuickCheck`, and *log* sets of states and schedules.
  
`./Proc --dump-process`:

   * Prints a representation of the message-passing protocol from `Prog.hs`.

`./Proc --dump-model`:

   * Write the files that `Liquid Haskell` or `QuickCheck` would inspect, but do not actually run them.

## Plans for future

- If (2) above fails, produce some counterexample to help understand why the prover was unable
