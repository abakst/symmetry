Parameter T : Type.

Definition M := (T * PidClass).

Inductive Stmt : Type :=
| s_skip  : Stmt
| s_send  : PidClass -> M -> Stmt
| s_recv  : M -> Stmt
| s_seq   : Stmt -> Stmt -> Stmt
| s_recv_l: list (M * Stmt) -> Stmt
| s_recv_x: (T * Var) -> Stmt -> Stmt
| s_iter  : Var -> Stmt -> Stmt
| s_loop  : MuVar -> Stmt -> Stmt
| s_var   : MuVar -> Stmt
(* These statements below never appear in original programs *)
| s_loop_body : MuVar -> Stmt -> Stmt
| s_loop_end  : MuVar -> Stmt -> Stmt.

Definition Process := (PidClass * Stmt).
Definition Config := list Process.

The three receive forms are:

- `s_recv`: normal message reception (value of type `T` + possible a Pid)

- `s_recv_l`: external choice

- `s_recv_x`: receive a Pid. This corresponds to "âˆ€x. recv(x)", for example

# Introduction

The kinds of programs we want to consider are here, annotated with
some mostly-plausible process descriptions
